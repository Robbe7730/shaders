# Shaders

My experiments with OptiFine shaders.

## Shaders

- `attempt-1`: Has shadows, Blinn-Phong shading on water and an attempt at waves
  in the water.
- `geometry_shaders`: Has nicer, colored shadows and does triangle subdivision
  in a geometry shader.
- `color-shaders`: Experimental shader that colors each gbuffer-shader a
  different color.
- `flat-shading`: Implement flat shading as described in our course computer
  graphics.
- `phong-shading`: Implement Phong shading as described in our course computer
  graphics.
